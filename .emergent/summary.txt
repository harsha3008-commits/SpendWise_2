The trajectory details the evolution of SpendWise, a privacy-first finance app. Initially, the AI engineer completed critical dark mode consistency fixes and addressed logout redirection issues. The user then introduced a major feature set: a background SMS reader, transaction analysis, and a fully functional settings page, prioritizing them as Settings -> SMS Reader -> Analytics.

The AI successfully implemented the Settings screen, adding profile management, notifications, and data controls. Subsequently, premium features (AI analysis, monthly reports) were integrated into Settings, requiring  for LLM capabilities and backend endpoints. A significant blank screen issue was resolved by fixing 's loading state.

The core differentiating feature, automatic Android SMS transaction parsing, was then implemented, achieving 80% accuracy. The user requested further enhancements for launch, including 90%+ accuracy, UI/UX polish, stability, compliance, monetization, and app store packaging. The current work focuses on making all elements of the Settings screen, such as detection statistics, data export/erase, two-factor authentication, and premium upgrade options, fully functional.

<product_requirements>
SpendWise is a local-first, privacy-first mobile finance app for Android/iOS. It uses an encrypted, blockchain-style ledger for tamper-resistant financial data. Core features include expense/income tracking, budgeting, bill reminders, and basic analytics. Monetization occurs via a premium subscription for advanced analytics, data export (PDF/CSV), and optional encrypted multi-device sync (IPFS). The app must support offline functionality. The tech stack includes Expo/React Native, FastAPI, MongoDB, Dexie, WebCrypto (AES-GCM, PBKDF2/Argon2), Razorpay, and Polygon. Security features include server-side Razorpay verification and secure key storage. Mandatory login, default light mode with a dark mode toggle, and persistent theme selection are required. Recent explicit requests include:
1.  **Background SMS Listener (Android-only):** Automatic parsing of transactional SMS for amount, type, merchant, date, and reference, storing them locally and updating the UI instantly.
2.  **Transaction Analysis & Monthly Expense Report:** Auto-categorization of expenses, monthly summaries (total spent/received, category pie chart, trend graph), and a Download Report (PDF/CSV) option.
3.  **Fully Functional Settings Page:** Profile management (edit name, email, password, picture), theme selection (light/dark with persistence), notifications (transaction/budget alerts), privacy & permissions (SMS/notification management, data export/erase), and a Premium section with upgrade options, AI expense analysis, and report generation.
4.  **Improve SMS parsing accuracy to 90%+**, UI/UX polish, app stability, compliance, and app store packaging for launch.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on fully implementing all missing functionalities within the  file. The user explicitly requested to ensure that Detection statistics and export data erase data two factor authentication upgrade to premium and data export privacy policy and help and support and upgraded option are working.

The AI engineer has begun this task by updating the  file in multiple steps. This involves adding the necessary logic and UI components to handle these features. The last action (Chat Message 257) was specifically focused on updating the Security section within the Settings to include the new functional handlers, indicating progress on features like Two-Factor Authentication. This work builds upon the previously added basic structure for Profile Management, Theme Selection, SMS Permissions, and the Premium Features section, aiming to make all these sub-sections fully interactive and functional.
