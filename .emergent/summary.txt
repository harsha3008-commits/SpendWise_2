<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully bootstrapped and developed SpendWise, a privacy-first, blockchain-style finance app. The trajectory details the process from initial product requirements to a production-ready MVP. Key phases included clarifying the tech stack (Expo, FastAPI, MongoDB, Polygon), resolving numerous dependency issues on both frontend and backend, establishing core data models and crypto utilities, building essential UI screens (onboarding, dashboard, transactions, bills, budgets, settings, wallet), and implementing critical backend logic for a hash-chained ledger and Razorpay integration. Comprehensive testing was performed for backend APIs and blockchain features, followed by frontend UI verification. The work culminated in generating extensive project documentation (README, LICENSE, etc.). Currently, the AI engineer is actively working on security hardening, addressing critical recommendations for , crypto implementation, backend security, and payment verification.

<product_requirements>
The user requested SpendWise, a local-first, privacy-first mobile finance app (Android/iOS via Capacitor) with a blockchain-style, tamper-resistant ledger. All financial data must remain on-device and be encrypted. Core features include expense/income tracking, budgets, bill reminders, and basic analytics. Monetization is via a premium subscription for advanced analytics, export, and optional encrypted multi-device sync (IPFS). The app must function offline. The tech stack includes TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Capacitor, IndexedDB (Dexie + AES), , WebCrypto, Chart.js, Razorpay (Stripe fallback), , , , and Vite. Backend is FastAPI+MongoDB with Polygon blockchain integration for anchoring. Security is paramount, with all user data encrypted at rest via PBKDF2/Argon2-derived AES-GCM keys. Payments use Razorpay SDK with local-only subscription validation. The app should have screens for onboarding, dashboard, transactions, bills, budgets, analytics, subscriptions, and settings, following a specified file structure and key functions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in implementing a series of critical security hardening measures based on user feedback. This includes:
1.  **Updating **: To ensure that sensitive files like  containing API keys and secrets are never committed to version control.
2.  **Enhancing **: To implement proper key derivation using PBKDF2/Argon2 with salt and iterations, and to enforce AES-GCM for all encryption operations, replacing any potential AES-CBC usage.
3.  **Hardening **: By adding a CORS whitelist, implementing rate limiting (likely using ), integrating JWT with expiry and refresh token mechanisms, and enforcing server-side Razorpay signature verification.
4.  **Validating inputs in **: By using Pydantic models for all API endpoints to ensure robust input validation.
The AI engineer's last action was installing missing dependencies required for these security enhancements and preparing to create a security audit script.
