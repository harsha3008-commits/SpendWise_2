The trajectory details the continued development of SpendWise, a privacy-first finance app. Initially, the focus was on critical security hardening, including updating , enhancing  for AES-GCM and proper key derivation, hardening  with CORS, rate limiting, JWT, and Razorpay verification, and input validation via Pydantic models.

The AI engineer resolved several technical issues: migrating Pydantic regex to pattern, addressing MongoDB index conflicts, and debugging persistent Expo frontend service issues (port conflicts, ngrok tunnel problems). Extensive backend and frontend testing confirmed security features (JWT auth, Razorpay verification) were functional, but revealed a critical disconnect in frontend-backend integration, particularly for JWT authentication and data fetching.

Subsequently, the AI integrated JWT authentication into the frontend, created dedicated login/register screens, and established an . Recent efforts focused on implementing mandatory login and a light/dark theme toggle, followed by user feedback to ensure dark mode consistency across all app sections and correct logout redirection. The AI is currently addressing these theme consistency and logout navigation issues.

<product_requirements>
SpendWise is a local-first, privacy-first mobile finance app for Android/iOS, featuring a blockchain-style, tamper-resistant ledger with all financial data encrypted on-device. Core functionalities include expense/income tracking, budgets, bill reminders, and basic analytics. Monetization is through a premium subscription for advanced analytics, export, and optional encrypted multi-device sync (IPFS). The app must function offline. The tech stack includes Expo/React Native, TypeScript, FastAPI, MongoDB, Dexie (IndexedDB) with AES encryption, WebCrypto (AES-GCM, PBKDF2/Argon2), Razorpay, and Polygon for blockchain anchoring. Security is paramount, with server-side Razorpay signature verification and secure key storage. Required screens are onboarding, dashboard, transactions, bills, budgets, analytics, subscriptions, and settings. Recent explicit requests include enforcing mandatory login, a default light mode UI, and a dark mode toggle in settings, with theme persistence and proper logout redirection.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding the newly implemented mandatory login and light/dark mode features. The user reported that:
1.  The dark mode was not consistently applying to all main sections of the app (specifically transactions, bills, budgets, and analytics screens).
2.  The logout functionality, while present, was not correctly redirecting to the login page after a user logged out.

To resolve these issues, the AI engineer first updated the main app layout () to properly structure the authentication flow, ensuring only the login page is visible when unauthenticated. Following this, the  was simplified. A logout button was added to . The current task involves systematically updating each of the mentioned screens (, , , ) to correctly consume the  and apply the chosen dark mode styles. The AI has already updated  and  and is in the process of updating  and .
